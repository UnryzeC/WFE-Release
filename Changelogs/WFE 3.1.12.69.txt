WFE 3.1.12.69

1. Fixed Cooldown UI time not getting hidden, when whole option is disabled.
2. Added "Display Time" option in Cooldown UI, when enabled, will draw cooldown text.
3. Fixed BLP limit remover not auto-updating regardless, now it updates regardless of if Graphics Auto Updater was selected or not.
4. WFEApp will now use Warcraft III install path from registry (war3.exe or Warcraft III.exe, based on which exe exists in this order), if no game path was specified.
5. @learn and @unlearn commands can now process ability list, example: @learn AUau,AOws,AHbz will learn/unlearn -> Unholy Aura, War Stomp and Blizzard.
6. New Command: @setabilitylevel - sets ability's level to input amount by RAW-code or by id. Example: @setabilitylevel AOws 2, this will set War Stomp to level 2.
	Note: instead of AOws you can also use its id: 1095726963, etc.
7. @id command will now print ability/item/unit's owner (aka whoever sells it, or whichever spellbook it belongs to).
	Example: Spell Book->Roar [ 'Aspb'->'Aroa' | 1098084450->1098018657 ].
8. Potentially fully fixed Minimap "pass-through" target (attack/spell/build, etc.) command, that would sometimes result in camera moving to the clicked area.
9. New @printstringdata command, this will check all Jass Strings and print them to a StringData.txt along with total length of all texts and how much memory they occupy.
10. Fixed Custom Stat Bars not working properly with units/destructables that use negative width.
11. Level Frame will now fully scretch horizontally, based on hp/mp bar heights.
