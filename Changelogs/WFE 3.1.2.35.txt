Changelog:

1. All Frame-related code has been refactored and re-optimised.
	Note: this could lead to some specific function causing fatal error, if it happens, it will be fixed, however most likely that won't happen.
2. Increased the width of Handle Counter frame, since it was a bit too small for screen sizes below mine.
3. Fixed Multiboard Display/Suppress issue within WFE frame control.
4. Multiboard now has smart position, and won't be "jumping" from one position to another whenever it's redrawn/updated via BJ functions.
5. Multiboard Displace option replaced with Leaderboard (now you can hide/show) Leaderboard.
6. HP/HP and Cooldown Label priorities reduced from 10000 to 5000, now Cursor should be above them.
7. Feature Hero Overhead Tip now properly works, it won't hide ALL overhead tips, but only on heroes, as it was supposed to.
8. @copy command will no longer change the player owner of the newly created unit to the command issuer, the original owning player will stay its owner.
