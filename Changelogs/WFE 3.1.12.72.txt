WFE 3.1.12.72

1. Fixed Cooldown UI time not getting hidden, when whole option is disabled.
2. Added "Display Time" option in Cooldown UI, when enabled, will draw cooldown text.
3. Fixed BLP limit remover not auto-updating regardless, now it updates regardless of if Graphics Auto Updater was selected or not.
4. WFEApp will now use Warcraft III install path from registry (war3.exe or Warcraft III.exe, based on which exe exists in this order), if no game path was specified.
5. @learn and @unlearn commands can now process ability list, example: @learn AUau,AOws,AHbz will learn/unlearn -> Unholy Aura, War Stomp and Blizzard.
6. New Command: @setabilitylevel - sets ability's level to input amount by RAW-code or by id. Example: @setabilitylevel AOws 2, this will set War Stomp to level 2.
	Note: instead of AOws you can also use its id: 1095726963, etc.
7. @id command will now print ability/item/unit's owner (aka whoever sells it, or whichever spellbook it belongs to).
	Example: Spell Book->Roar [ 'Aspb'->'Aroa' | 1098084450->1098018657 ].
8. Potentially fully fixed Minimap "pass-through" target (attack/spell/build, etc.) command, that would sometimes result in camera moving to the clicked area.
9. New @printstringdata command, this will check all Jass Strings and print them to a StringData.txt along with total length of all texts and how much memory they occupy.
10. Fixed Custom Stat Bars not working properly with units/destructables that use negative width.
11. Level Frame will now fully scretch horizontally, based on hp/mp bar heights.
12. @handlecounter and @printhandles now also show/print Handle Index (this shows how many indexes are used for Jass variables).
	Note: if this number keeps rising, this means you have "local handle" leak.
13. Removed WFESettingsBase.ini.
14. Removed WFEConfigBase.ini.
15. Removed WFEAppStyleDefault.ini.
16. Fixed issue causing Hotkeys to break, this was related to utilising std::vector copy over just using a pointer.
	Note: this was a horrible thing to have to begin with, it was a leftover of my ancient code... ;/
17. Fixed FPS Limit and Refresh Rate defaulting to 64 on save, if Display option was disabled.
	Note: it will only save if option is enabled.
18. Fixed HP/MP text still showing percent / regen even when main option was disabled.
	Note: originally another option was planned to act as draw yes/no and menu enabling/disabling custom HP/MP text instead.
19. Added CLayer::CalculateDepth hook to make portrait unclippable by terrain and such.
	Thanks to sotzaii_shuen for the find.
20. Fixed Auto Injector conflicting with UjAPI, aka if game was launched with injected UjAPI.
	Note: both libraries hook statbars, thus secondary dll (wfe) always tried to hook function that was mid-hooked.
21. Library now has module tracking to prevent secondary library from loading, and it's able to see newer modules if they were loaded and so on.
  Note: this only will work starting this version with all libraries equal or higher version than this.
    Modules: AngelScript, FastMenu, FPSUnlocker, UnlockMapSize, MultiWindow, RepplaySpeedUnlocker, UjAPI and WFE.
