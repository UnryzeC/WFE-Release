WFE 3.1.9.62

1. Fixed Fatal Error whenever decaying unit was selected via Unit Autoselection/Selection.
2. Added Enable setting in Heroes Section, by default this option is disabled.
	Note 1: this was added to offset some weird Platforms that use 1.28f that for some reason cause the game to crash.
	Note 2: this does NOT happen on pure 1.28f.
3. Fixed Default Profile not being selected on first launch, causing fake errors.
4. Profiles can now be renamed, once you press Enter, its name will update, while retaining previous settings.
	Note: WFEConfigDefault.ini CAN be removed/renamed too, but it's not advised to do so.
5. Fixed negative HP values, when unit would exceed int32 hp limit (aka. 2,147,483,647).
	Note: yes, there are horrendous maps that use such values for no apparent reason.
6. Updated Chinese localisation (thanks EdgarL).
