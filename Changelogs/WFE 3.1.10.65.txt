WFE 3.1.10.65

1. Major code refresh/remake for a minor performance uplift, this could create some new fatal errors (but highly unlikely).
2. Fixed Fatal Error whenever decaying unit was selected via Unit Autoselection/Selection.
	Note: this time for sure. :/
3. Fixed "Enable" flag in Hero Binds always defaulting to true.
4. "Profiles" folder will be automatically created, if it did not exist at all, or if for some reason it was not moved by user/updater.
