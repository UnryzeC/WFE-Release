WFE 3.1.7.55

1. Fixed not working map size limit remover for patches 1.27b and 1.28f.
2. Fixed 16:10 resolution not being auto-detected.
	Note: 16:10 will use 16:9 data.
3. Changed "Status" text to "FPS Unlocker".
4. Removed "New" and "Legacy" options from FPS Unlocker, as Legacy no longer does anything.
	Note: now it's back to On/Off option. To actually limit FPS to your screen refresh rate, please use V-Sync.
	Note 2: V-Sync only works with DirextX9 and is automatically activated on patches 1.26a and lower as they use DirectX8 by default.
5. Fixed "broken" UI in Replay mode, now it's fully resizing/redrawing itself as in normal games.
