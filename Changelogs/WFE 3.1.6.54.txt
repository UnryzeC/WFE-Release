WFE 3.1.6.54

1. Fixed Cooldown UI and Buff UI refresh time not setting to lower than 100.
2. Moved Upgraded UI to its own section, due to a massive overhaul.
3. Added Auto Detect Aspect Ratio flag option to Upgraded UI section.
4. Added Aspect Ratio combobox option to Upgraded UI section.
5. Default Aspect Ratio of Upgraded UI has been set to 16:9.
	Note: 4:3 for now uses 16:9 values, as I cannot really test 4:3.
6. Fixed broken CCoccupUI with night elf gold mines.
7. Fixed Buff UI not recreating after first map.
8. Added Fast Menu setting to Settings Section.
	Note: this simply makes page transitions nearly instant, no more .67 to 1. waits between pages!
	Note: thanks fenathesnake for the idea.
9. Added Slim Cursor option to Upgraded UI section.
	Note: this now will also work in main menu and can be adjusted with Aspect Ratio option.
10. Check Updates option in WFE now is "Off" by default.
	Note: this was done for Windows 7 users, on which WebClient no longer works, as Microsoft has abandoned support for this OS.
