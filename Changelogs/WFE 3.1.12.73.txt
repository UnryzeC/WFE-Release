1. Fixed crash on 1.27b, yet again for some reason one particular offset for CGxDevice is different.
  Note: it was different only on this patch.
2. Fixed unpause command not working.
  Note: whole pause/unpause logic was streamlined and reworked.
3. Rollbacked old QuickMessageSend handling, new one was too fast for game to process...
4. Fixed "restore" command not restoring mana.
