WFE 3.1.4.47

1. Whole UI has been reworked and brought to nearly identical level with Reforged.
2. Cursor size has been adjusted to the widescreen.
3. Fixed cooldown not being drawn for enemy shops that can be accessed.
4. Graphics settings are no longer automatically updated, a separate button has been added in WFEApp.exe, press "Refresh Graphics Settings" button each time you wish to enable/disable DirectX9 or V-Sync.
5. Buff Duration text priority lowered from 10000 to 5000, now cursor will be drawn over it.
6. Updated Buff Bar for Upgraded Interface, now it's more compact.
7. Decreased default font size of Buff Duration Draw text frame from .013 to .0105.
	Note: this change is "reverted" if Upgraded Buff Bar option is enabled, as it doesn't need font size limit.
8. Increased the size of the Buff Icons for when Upgraded Buff Bar is enabled.
