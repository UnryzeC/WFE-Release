WFE 3.1.11.67

1. Fixed Heroes binds not selecting paused heroes.
2. Fixed incorrect Registry id for maxfps (it does not really affect anything, but still, thanks to DiX998 for finding this issue).
3. Fixed WFE binds with/without autocast clicking "through" minimap and moving camera to that spot. (Note: this does not fix the basic normal clicks, since again, those are caused by Blizzard's problematic click handling).
4. Fixed lockfb registry Id on 1.28f, its ID apparently was changed on 1.28a and above.
	Note: this id change was hitting Lighting option instead.
5. Fixed Buff Duration text size not changing if "Draw Indicator" was disabled.
6. WFEApp's size was adjusted to 600pixels.
7. WFEApp's height can now be resized.
8. Some buttons in main menu were slightly shrinked to fit the new size.
