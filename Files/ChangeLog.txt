	20. Added WFE.mpq as automatically loaded MPQ, as long as it exists in the same folder was WFEDLL.dll, works with .mix too, if same condition is met.
	21. Files in WFE.mpq are not all loaded into game, you may modify this file if you wish, just don't remove or break the indicator :).
	22. Added custom AoE indicator to WFE.mpq, for Attack / Spell Usage draw.
	23. Added Interface Menu, here you can configure parts of the UI you want to disable.
	24. Added Enable UI Modification option to Interface Menu, if enabled will take selected options and utilize them.
	25. Added Black Bars option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Black Bars on Game UI.
	26. Added Infor Bar option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Unit Information Bar (damage, armour, level, etc.) from Game UI.
	27. Added Left Console option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide whole Left part of the Game UI, excluding the buttons that are placed on it.
	28. Added Right Console option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide whole Right part of the Game UI, excluding the buttons that are placed on it.
	29. Added Upper Menu Bar option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Menu Panel from Game UI.
	30. Added Resource Bar option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Resource Panel (gold, lumber, food and upkeep) from Game UI.
	31. Added Minimap option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Minimap and its buttons from Game UI.
	32. Added Ability Buttons option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide all Abilities/Command Buttons from Game UI. (this does not disabled them, only hides).
	33. Added Portrait option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Portrait with its Health and Mana Labels from Game UI.
	34. Added Item Buttons option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide all Item buttons from Game UI. (If Right Console is not disabled, you will still see the empty slots).
	35. Added Hero Bar option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide all Hero Icons from Game UI. (F1-F6 will still work just fine.)
	36. Added Inventory Cover option in Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Inventory Cover texture from Game UI.
	37. Added Peon Bar option to Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Peon Button from UI.
	38. Added Time Indicator option to Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Time of Day Indicator from Game UI.
	39. Added Tooltip option to Interface Menu, if disabled, will hide Tooltip from Game UI. (This hides only the buttons/labels tooltip that is above the Command Bar).
	40. Added Mouse Tooltip option to Interface Menu, if enabled, will attach Tooltip to the mouse coordinates, instead of it being in the right corner above Command Bar (Abilities).
	41. Changed @id to @unitid, this command still will print selected unit Id, as it did before.
	42. New @id command will now print Id of Unit/Item/Destructable/Ability under cursor.
	43. @copy now can also copy selected items.
	44. Added translations to new options via Google Translate.
	45. Fixed QuickMessage option, now it works with multiple same keys, previously messages that had "conflicting" keys would simply be skipped.
	46. QuickMessage now prints "multiline" text, if Hotkeys of multiple messages share the same key.
	47. Manabar fixed for 1.24e, offset used for new way of Handling Bars was wrong.

WFE 2.20

	1. Fixed Mouse Tooltip clipping out if you changed Window Size.
	2. Modified @createunit / @createitem commands, now it takes either XXXX parameter or actual integer value i.e. H00J or 1211117642.
	3. Fixed DrawIndicator issue, where it would only draw at first unit in the node, now instead it will draw on actual active unit from subgroup.
	4. Improved WFE.mpq loader, now any models inside of this MPQ will have highest priority and even maps won't be able to overwrite them.
	5. Changed options to enable/disable left/right Console to Enable/Disable console, this new option does not make in-game chat invisible when hidden.
	6. Fixed wrong position of Text/Shadow labels in Cooldown UI.
	7. Draw Spell AoE now has higher priority than SelfCast or AutoCast Toggle, to prevent collision and break of Ability/Item usage.
	8. Fixed incorrect colouring of Neutral Units Health Bar.
	9. Added Aggressive as a separate Health Bar Colour.
	10. Ability/Item binds now have higher priority than Hotkeys.
	11. Added WheelUp and WheelDown as possible binds.
	12. Camera modification will not trigger on WheelEvent if it is bound to any of the abilities or items, this does not affect Camera Bind with +/- binds.
	13. Camera Override now immediately updates to modified Camera value, instead of waiting for any User Camera Action to update values.
	14. Updated Camera system, now it immediately updates Fog Height to same value as FarZ, this will prevent the need to rotate camera inwards to force update Fog Height.
	15. Added Draw Sight Radius to Custom Indicators.
	16. Added setting Sight Radius colour option.
	17. Sight Radius is now also printed in Defence data, underneath movement speed.
	18. Added Loading Notification option, now it is toggleable, instead of always being active.
	19. Loading Notification no longer maximizes Warcraft III, when it procs.

WFE 2.20 Hotfix

	1. Fixed Draw Bound Spell Indicator from not activating spell as well, now it also clicks the ability button and draws indicator at the same time.
	2. Fixed Spellbook / Ability binds not working and instead utilizing Ability binds.
	3. Fixed fatal error of test command @unitid, if no unit was selected.
	4. Added the possibility of using Shift to chain WFE Button Binds, some code was revised to support this, you can thank @goodlyhero(Discord) for me doing it.
	5. Fixed Unit options Save/Select, not working at all in latest updates.

WFE 2.21 (experimental)

	1. Completely nuked old HP/MP regen drawing code, now it fully hooks UpdatePortraitData function, instead of roundabout way of hooking onChangeHP/MPLabel. 
	2. Separated HP and MP regen options into two, now you can choose whichever you want, instead of both at the same time. 
	3. Completely nuked old Attack Speed drawing code, now it fully hooks UpdateCInfoPanelIconDamage, and is instead called Custom Attack Tip. 
	4. Extended overall data that Custom Attack Tip prints, range is now ALWAYS displayed as a number, and green/red colours are applied if default value was buffed/debuffed. 
	5. Added Extended Attack Tip option, this will concatenate total value of attack/attack speed/cooldown of attack and print on the right their sum formula, be it positive or negative. 
	6. Completely nuked old Movement Speed drawing code, now if fully hooks UpdateCInfoPanelIconArmour, and is instead called Custom Defence Tip. 
	7. Extended overall data that Custom Defence Tip prints, meaning movement speed's green/red colours are applied if default value was buffed/debuffed. 
	8. Added Vision range print back to Custom Defence Tip printing. 
	9. Added Extended Defence Tip option, this will concatenate total value of attack/attack speed/cooldown of attack and print on the right their sum formula, be it positive or negative. 
	10. Fixed issue with SHIFT + LMB/MMB/RMB firing off XButton1/XButton2. 
	11. Reworked UI of WFE.exe yet again, now buttons inside of the Options Panel have even space. 
	12. Added LastButton/LastTextBox timed save, this allows the user to use MouseWheel on top of the Buttons without triggering them. 
	13. When Button/TextBox is clicked, it is saved for 5 seconds, and accepts inputs from the user, once 5 seconds are up, the button will ignore any pressed key, until it is clicked again. 
	14. Added TestCommands.txt to WFE package, as per request of some of the users. 
	15. Fixed mouse wheel not working for resource trade if it was bound to some other button. 
	16. Fixed incorrect Spellbook recognition, now it also checks if there are any other existing button, instead of only checking the exit button. 
	17. WFE when minimised, will minimise itself to tray, should have added this long-long time ago. 
	18. Added OnGameEvent hook, that will substitute TimerProc that is currently handling MouseLock, GameNotification, GameUI load/unload and so on, this will make all of my features work snappier. 
	19. MouseLock now only works when you are in-game (aka playing some map), it no longer will bind the mouse while in menu. 
	20. @setas changed to @setacd, since it was setting Attack Cooldown value, which was a tad confusing. 
	21. Added @setas back, it is editing the Bonus Attack Speed, as it used to, meaning it can be either -100% or +400%. 
	22. Added Write Magic Resist option, this will write the value under Damage Reduction. 
	23. WndProc fully reworked, all different WindowMessages are solely handled in switch/case method, for very-very minor performance improvement. 
	24. Fixed Window Freeze issue when XButton1 or XButton2 were pressed, if PageUP / A keys were bound to any spell/item. 
	25. Added Health Bar Height control, meaning you can modify the Y size of the Health Bar while in-game. Changes are applied nearly instantly. 
	26. Added Mana Bar Height control, meaning you can modify the Y size of the Mana Bar while in-game. Changes are applied nearly instantly. 
	27. Added Mana Bar Colour option, this simply does the same thing as Health Bar colours, albeit it is not divided by the same categories as HP, since that would make no sense. 
	28. Added Hero Only option for Mana Bar, once toggled, only Heroes will have Mana Bar drawn on them. 
	29. Slight improvement of code for Load Notification and generally for all the data preloading that WFE needs to utilize less Memory and CPU. 
	30. Old Camera Height option now is named Camera Distance. 
	31. Added Camera Height Control, this only modifies the ZOffset of the camera, allowing you to take a closer look at models / terrain and so on, if you wish it. 
	32. Instant RMC renamed into Repeat Right Mouse Click. 
	33. Repeat Right Mouse Click option now uses EVENT_GAME_TICK instead of TimerProc, meaning, now it is even faster, so it is recommended so you increase the default delay. 
	34. Improved SmartCast/AutoCast code, now it is more efficient and should lead to even less chances of losing control of the hero, without increasing the load on CPU. 
	35. Custom UI modification now is tied to EVENT_GAME_TICK, meaning now there is no jitter for UI disabling when the game starts. 
	36. Mouse Tooltip is now handled by WndProc in WM_MOUSEMOVE case, instead of a TimerProc. 
	37. Probably fixed slow-motion mouse issue, that is happening to some users, mainly to those who use lower DPI settings, hopefully this issue will appear no more.
	38. Fixed fatal error with ManaBar in maps that disable PreselectUI completely.
	39. Added @setmovetype command, this fully edits unit's movement type, for example from walking to flying, indexes: Foot = 1 / Fly = 2 / Float = 3 / Amphibian = 4.
		Example: @setmovetype 2 => this will give the unit the possibility to fly, and so on.

WFE 2.21 (experimental) Hotfix

	1. WFE hide to tray removed, since it wasn't able to re-draw objects while being hidden, hence not working as intended.
	2. Restored -100% and +400% maximum attack speed factors, now it once again displays correct values for attack speed in the tooltip.
	3. Fixed CInfoAttackDamage, it was double adding bonus attack, and displaying wrong values in the tooltip.
	4. Fixed a rare bug, when disabling Attack/Defence custom info, would not actually disable the hook.

WFE 2.21 (experimental) Hotfix 2

    1. ManaBar fully rewritten from ASM to C++.
    2. ManaBar now fully copies the size and dimension values from HealthBar, instead of me trying to guess them.
    3. ManaBar now no longer unclips, if unit is near the edge of the screen, it will instead shift to the same side as HealthBar.
    4. ManaBar will not be drawn if unit now suddenly has 0 maximum mana, it would draw blank before.
    5. ManaBar now utilises less CPU/RAM resources, optimisation yay...
	6. ManaBar YOffset changed to HealthBarY - ( HealthBarHeight + .002f ) -> meaning now changing HealthBar height won't leave a gap between them.
	7. Fixed non-appearing HP/MP portrait text, when SimpleConsole is disabled, had to fix offsets for VTables on patches 1.27a-1.28f.
	8. Added @gamebase command, this prints Game.dll and Storm.dll image address. i.e. 6F00000 for Game.dll or 1F00000 for Storm.dll.
	9. Added @acquirerange command, this is only useful, to balance out new Attack Range, so the unit actually can automatically attack on new Attack Range.
	10. Added @rsgcamera command, this resets camera controller back to game controller, this is useful for maps like YouTD that sometimes make camera stuck, or maps like that.
	11. Commands: @stringhash/@unitid/@location/@ms/@id/@version/@gamebase/@rsgcamera/@checkaxis are now available in Multiplayer.
	12. Added Hide to Tray option in WFE.exe, by default it is turned off. Sadly it doesn't restore ScrollBar position, but all the previous bugs are fixed.
	13. All build abilities are now recognized as SpellBook.
	14. Fixed 'Amai' (human shop/marketlplace, etc...) bug, which caused CooldownUI not to display its cooldown.
	15. 'Amai' added to IsSpellbook check, was not added before.
	16. Fixed non-working Draw Attack On Hover option.
	17. Fixed weird interaction of Draw Spell AoE On Hover, now it works properly and is instantly hidden if you are hovering over a button that contains no range or is not even a button.
	18. Default Battle.net latency set to 250, for users on 1.28f, it will set the limit to 100 (meaning any value above 100 will be discarded).
		Note: this was probably the cause for "lags" since it worked as DelayReducer and for versions 1.26a-1.27b was setting the default 250 down to 100.
	19. Added @food command
	20. Cooldown check is now ignored on Droppable items that are on cooldown and Right Click SmartCast was issued.

WFE 2.21 (experimental) Hotfix 3

	1. Fixed fatal error if Manabar was turned on and WFE was injected while in-game and Always Show Health Bars was on.
		Note: Manabar patch won't be activated if you injected WFE.dll while being in a game, to prevent Fatal Errors.
	2. Fixed Custom Health/Mana text being draw on top of the default one, if Black Bars was toggled while Console was hidden.
	3. Added CGameStateEventHandler function hook, this is used to catch event->id == 3, aka the Pause id.
	4. Disable Pause feature was remade to not use WindowProc WM_ACTIVATE message, instead it will simply ignore the Game Pause Mechanic.
		Note: This only works in Single Player as it was supposed to. Sadly this limits the game to 15 FPS while in background, I do not know what function causes this.
	5. Fixed Backspace being unable to remove characters, if it was bound to any hotkey. WFE will now always consider Backspace non-hotkey, yet it will fulfil what is bound to it.
	6. Fixed broken Health Bars if Always Show Health bars option was on and Disable Pause was enabled.
	7. Added Game Type Recognition to WFE, now WFE will know when you are in a Single Player mode, only then the Disable Pause will activate.

WFE 2.21 (experimental) Hotfix 4

    1. Fixed an issue with wrong HP/MP data written under portrait in replays, now WFE grabs the owner of the portrait and not a selected unit.
    2. Fixed wrong offsets for Disable Pause on patches 1.27a/1.27b/1.28f, now it works correctly.
    3. Added Borderless option in Launcher, this will make the game start in pseudo full-screen mode if used with -window launch argument.
    4. Fixed bug with IsCNetGame check returning wrong values.
    5. Re-re-re-fixed SpellBook detection, I really should stop trying to optimise code at 5 a.m....
    6. Added ContextMenu to WFE in Tray Mode. Now you can Right Click on it and click Exit button and it will close the application.
    7. Tray Icon will no longer unwrap if Double Right Click was issued. It will only react to Double Left Mouse Click.

WFE 2.22

    1. Fixed Windowed/Borderless issue, that caused it not to remember previous position and size.
    2. Added Hero Only option for Hotkey binding.
    3. Added IsCPlayerAlly/Enemy functions, JassPlayerAlly/Enemy type check was removed.
    4. Added a more thoughtful Warcraft III window scan, this should help with clients like RGC and so on, that mangle Window Name.
    5. Added the commands into ProcessChatMessage, meaning now you can bind WFE commands in Quick Message and they will work as if you typed them.
    6. Changed test commands that set any value to use "set" keyword.
		Example: @str 500 is now @setstr 500 and so on.
	7. Added TestCommands.ini, this config file contains all commands, you can edit the trigger for test commands and the commands itself to your liking, if nothing is changed, default data is loaded.
		Note: this data is loaded only once, update button from WFE.exe or WFEDll.dll won't do anything, since I doubt it has any use.
	8. Optimised thread clean ups, should be much safer now.
	9. Fixed Draw Attack Indicator issue, where it would generate and show an indicator, but it wouldn't move with the unit, if unit has no attack at all.
	10. Added Launch option to Tray, this allows to launch the game while WFE is in tray, duh.
	11. HP/MP regeneration now will be hidden if either of them is exactly 0, meaning if HP regen is 0, then it won't be drawn, that doesn't affect MP regen, unless it's 0 too.
	12. Launch Game Option is now handled via Task, so it won't freeze WFE and allow you to still access it, while it launches the game.
	13. Probably fixed the freezing issue, when WFE somehow fails to launch the game or inject a .dll, though further tests will show if it's fixed or not.
	
WFE 2.22 (Hotfix 1)

	1. Fixed OnExit fatal error due to thread clean up, reworked code again, it is still a safe code instead of the pre 2.22 code.
	2. Fixed Fatal Error with NRD map, PG Protect - is such a curse.
	3. Fixed Draw Bound Spell instantly disappearing, I used a wrong variable in program and it was using LastEnteredButton, oopsie.
	4. Fixed WFE.exe being unable to load if WFEConfig.ini did not exist.

WFE 2.23

	1. Added internal function for checking if given axis are visible, not fogged and not masked to player.
	2. Fixed issue with opened empty chatbox when test command was used via QuickMessage.
	3. Added Draw Damage feature.
	4. Added Physical and Magical colouring options in Draw Damage feature.
	5. Added Physical X offset and Magical X offset in Draw Damage feature. This helps mitigate damage "stacking" so physical and magical damages are drawn on different positions.
	6. Added Height option in Draw Damage feature.
	7. Added Angle option in Draw Damage feature.
	8. Added Speed option in Draw Damage feature.
	9. Added Size option in Draw Damage feature.
	10. Added Duration option in Draw Damage feature.
	11. Added Hero Only option in Draw Damage feature.
	12. Added 4 buttons with Draw Option Modes: All/Ally/Enemy/Mine. All - simply selects all of them and unticks all if deselected.
		*Note 1: Damage will not be drawn if they are in fog or simply invisible to player "watching".
		*Note 2: Physical damage is only the damage caused by autoattack, anything else is considered "magical" by the game.
	13. Added Clear Chat option in HotKeys. Note: this will clear actual chat messages written by players.
	14. Possibly fixed random desync issue, further tests are needed still.
	15. Added .asi support for Additional Libraries preloader. (Currently .dll/.mix/.asi are supported).
	16. Added support for all True Sight abilities, it will draw the Sight AoE.
	17. Reworked Spell Draw code a bit, now ability is taken GetCUnitAbility, rather than from a button, this fixes the drawing issue when you don't have enough mana for the ability, Blizzard removes Ability pointer for some reason...
	18. Fixed issue of AoE not being drawn for spells that hide original button, while they are 'pressed'.
	19. Added EVENT_UNIT_USE_ITEM hook.
	20. Added EVENT_UNIT_SPELL_CHANNEL hook.
	21. Added EVENT_UNIT_SPELL_CAST hook.
	22. Added EVENT_UNIT_SPELL_EFFECT hook.
	23. Added EVENT_UNIT_SPELL_FINISH hook.
	24. Added EVENT_UNIT_SPELL_ENDCAST hook.
	25. Added @nocd command, used spell/item will be reset after UNIT_SPELL_EFFECT and UNIT_USE_ITEM trigger is finished, if unit is paused, then ability will be reset once pause fades.
		*Note: If item was fully consumed, a duplicate of it will still start a cooldown, since it was "lost".
	26. Reverted Hotkey button check, now same buttons can be bound for multiple Hotkeys. Example: Clear Chat with Backspace and Clear Unit with Backspace. Previously only first one in order would work.
	27. Added Toggle Multiboard State hotkey option in HotKeys. (this minimises/hides the multiboard).
	28. Added Show/Hide Multiboard State hotkey option in HotKeys. (this hides/unhides the multiboard). *Note: this simply mimics MultiboardSuppress function.
	29. Fixed Chat Box requiring to press Enter twice if QuickMessage was used.

WFE 2.23 (Update)

	1. Added GetCGamePreferences (this simply returns a pointer to Warcraft III registry).
	2. Added SetCGameRegistryInteger/Float.
	3. Added UpdateCGameRegistryValue.
	4. Added GetCGameRegistryInteger/Float.
	5. Changed FPS Unlocker, now it also edits refresh rate along with maxfps.
		*Note: you might need to restart the game when you patch it for the first time, for it to take effects.
	6. Fixed an issue when normal chat typing would leave Chat Box open.
	7. Changed nocd grabbing unit and ability from _EFFECT to _EFFECT + _FINISH + _ENDCAST. Pushed back values are unique, so no duplicates will be accepted, to prevent overflow and retain optimisation.
	8. Added IsReplay function, this function is used in CGameStateEventHandler and will prevent Disable Pause from triggering if it's replay.
	9. Show/Hide Ability Buttons feature will now also hide ReplayPanel if it is disabled.
	
WFE 2.23 (Update 2)

	1. Fixed broken Minimap, if it was disabled in UI modification, before map actually loaded. It is now hidden with a small delay to prevent it.
	2. DamageDraw will now also serve as a flag for CUnitOnDamage hook, meaning if it is disabled it won't hook and if it was hooked, it will unhook it.
		Note: apparently damage processing caused desyncs for some reason, this is a 50/50 measure to keep the feature, but also make it toggleable if it will still be unstable, to prevent desyncs.

WFE 2.23 (Update 3)

    1. Reworked Disable Pause back to how it used to work, it will no longer block any other "Pause" other than the inactive window pause.
        Note: If the newer style suited more, I can technically make the mode toggle-able, but honestly, after some testing, older style seemed to be better and more robust.
    2. One last time changed Hotkey parser, normal X0Y0... -> A_X0Y0 and items from Num... -> I_X0Y0, this is to simplify some of the code for the application.
    3. Reworked Draw Attack Speed code, now it solely uses Attack Speed Factor instead of Bonus Attack Speed. This should be final change and it should be +-99% accurate.
    4. Fixed incorrect Total Attacks Per Second calculation in Draw Attack Speed.
    5. Optimised calculations in Draw Attack Speed by around 60%, this won't yield significant performance increase, since it wasn't that bad to begin with.

WFE 2.23 (Update 4)

    1. Changed Attack Speed Cooldown tip from /sec to sec, since cooldown is measured in seconds and not in something per second.
    2. Fixed wrong Attack Tip and Extended Tip calculation, was not working correctly when stats were involved, added additional BonusDamage calculation to offset it.

WFE 2.24

    1. Added ALT + Click on Abilities/Items, this will print their cooldown to allied chat.
    2. Added ALT + Click on Buffs, this will print their remaining duration to allied chat.
    3. Delay(ms) button is now a CheckBox in WFE application and is responsible for the whole part being enabled/disabled.
    4. Display button is now CheckBox in WFE application and is responsible for the whole part being enabled/disabled.
    5. Added Refresh Rate option in Display section, this will modify Refresh Rate value in Warcraft 3 registry, now it's separate from FPS Limit. Default value is 0, it will only work if setting is greater than 0.
        Note: It's always a good idea to set this value to your monitor's current Refresh Value.
    6. Even more code optimisation, because why not?
    7. Disable Single Player Pause now functions as a mix of the old function and new one together, as to mitigate Health Bar duplication issue.
    8. FPS Limit default value is now 0, it will only work if it's greater than 0. | Suggested value is 64 or higher.
    9. Added Frequently Asked Questions file (aka FAQ.txt) to archive, for those who need a written explanation of features. ;)
    10. Around 20+ more undocumented changes that I forgot to write, because I forgot to write them down and because I am lazy. >_>"

WFE 2.25

    1. Fixed remaining issues with .mix causing the game to throw fatal error on closing.
    2. All default HotKeys for WFE are removed, this will allow to keep them 'empty' instead of them being reset to default.
    3. Default Hotkeys will be kept via WFEConfigBase.ini, if you do not have WFEConfig.ini, all the settings will be taken from WFEConfigBase.ini instead.
    4. Fixed Spellbook recognition (this time should be final), now it should never "collide" with normal binds and vice-versa.
    5. "Neutral Units / Shop" was remade into "Shops", the new system will consider ANY unit that can sell ANYTHING as a shop, as opposed to just the NEUTRAL unit.
    6. Fixed the issue when clicking a bound button in WFE while cursor is up and the button has the Smartcast option it wouldn't fire it. (Related to point #1).
    7. Added the possibility  to ALT + Click on Attack Icon to instantly type to chat your minimum and maximum attack values.
    8. Added the possibility  to ALT + Click on Armour Icon to instantly type to chat your armour values.
    9. Added the possibility  to ALT + Click on Stats Icon to instantly type to chat your Strength/Agility/Intelligence values.
    10. Added Cooldown Text Size Setting, now you can edit the font size, instead of it being set once by me and that's it.
    11. Additional optimisations again and around 30~40+ undocumented changes, as they are of no relevance to anyone, but me.

WFE 2.26

    1. Fixed an issue with X3Y0 Key bind on spells/etc where it would collide with cancel button, by simply issuing a click order if cancel button is up and SmartCast is on.
    2. Added FPS Draw Hook.
    3. Added FPS Advanced Info option, it will display currently occupied memory by Warcraft 3.
    4. Added Multiboard option to Custom UI section, now it can be always disabled/enabled if needed.
    5. Added Multiboard Displacement, when enabled will allow WFE to move Multiboard according to the Custom UI, won't move if disabled (fix for Dota map :/).
    6. Removed one of the Event Hooks, to increase some performance, as a similar function will take its place instead of both being active.
    7. Changed .toc file and .fdf file names in WFEMPQ to avoid collision with my MemHackAPI map.
    8. Optimisations again, yaay... >_>"

WFE 2.26 Update 1

    1. Fixed incorrect VTable offset on 1.24e for CCommandButton, was using CCommandButtonData instead, which caused Alt + Click on any Command Button (Ability/Item) to not be recognized by WFE.
    2. Added "Not enough mana" text, whenever you are too low on mana for the spell, instead of writing to chat its cooldown or if it's ready or not.
	
WFE 2.27

	1. Moved all Frame information and Attack/Defence localisations to Localisation.init. Meaning you can edit what text it writes, any language supported by your Warcraft 3 will work.
	2. All Test Commands print information was moved to TestCommands.ini, so you can modify it to the language of your liking, etc.
	3. CreateThreadA has been switched with std::thread instead, which should make the thread closing safe now and without issues.
	4. Frame Limit and Refresh Rate are no longer tied to Display Status, meaning they will always write to Registry.
	5. Additional optimisation for Health/Mana print.
	6. Additional Optimisation for Attack/Defence print.
	7. Additional optimisation to TestCommands and Frame Data (Button cooldown/ready, etc.).
	8. New commands added: 
		1) @settoid - morphs unit to input typeid.
		2) @setitemslots - sets unit item slots to number.
		3) @version - prints Warcraft 3 Patch and WFE version.
		4) @gametype - prints currently active game type, i.e: Single / Local / Battle.net
	9. @id will now prioritise the object under mouse, if there is nothing then will grab from selection.
	10. @createunit and @createitem replaced with @create, which automatically guesses what to create.
	11. @create can now create Destructables too.
	12. @setscale can now affect both items and destructables.
	13. @sethp can now affect items and destructables.
	14. @setmodel can now affect items and destructables
	15. @teleport can now affect items and destructables.
	16. @remove can now affect items and destructables.
	17. @copy can now affect destructables.
	18. @location can now affect items and destructables.
	19. Fixed .mix fatal error on close for the last time.
	20. Fixed Damage Draw drawing damage taken by invisible units. (it should only draw if you can actually see invisible unit).
	21. Removed Main Window Name and Window Name settings, as they are now obsolete.
	22. WFE.exe will now search for Warcraft 3 by Process Name instead, Process Name can be set in the settings now.
	23. Added Auto Warcraft 3 Injector, it will search for war3.exe and automatically inject WFE.dll to it.
	24. Added Auto Warcraft 3 Injector delay control, the default value is 100ms.
	25. Added Auto Warcraft 3 Injector flag control, this will turn this feature on/off, by default it's off.
	26. WFE.exe Inject button will now also inject all libraries from Libraries folder.
	
WFE 2.27 Update 1

	1. Fixed ALT + Click issue with Resource Bar, where it would react as if mouse is over it, when it's not.
	2. Fixed WFE.exe fatal error when w3l.exe was launched instead of war3.exe.
	3. Fixed QuickMessage printing gibberish instead of actual text (forgot to add .c_str( ) to string :\).
	
WFE 2.27 Update 2

	1. Fixed PrintTextToScreen function, TlsValue offset was modified on patches 1.28a+ apparently, so IsGame check was not working properly... :\
	2. Reworked WFE.exe Launch, Inject and Auto Injector functions to be dependent on each other.
		*Meaning Auto Injector will turn off until game launched via it is closed and Launch button will not launch game while it had injection via Injector or Auto Injector.
		Note: do not mix and match these options anyways, since there is no point. Meaning either use Launch button or Auto Injector option.
	3. Restored re-creation of child object in WFE.exe, which was responsible for re-drawing buttons/labels, etc.
		Note: This was done due to the child object breaking if it sat in Tray for too long... :/

WFE 2.27 Update 3

	1. Additional code optimisation + re-factoring.
	2. @panim test command now also works with animation names, i.e. "attack" / "attack gold", etc. Quotes are not needed.
	3. @panim now also works on items and destructables.
	4. New test command @settimedlifestate - pauses/unpauses timed life.
		Note: it has same bug as original UnitPauseTimedLife. Meaning if you double pause, the progress bar will lose its filling colour.
	5. New test command @settimescale - will set timescale of selected unit/item/destructable to input number.
	
WFE 2.27 Update 4

	1. Added hook for jShowInterface, Custom UI is forcefully updated whenever this function is envoked to restore UI to whichever settings were chosen.
	2. Added hook for jEnableUserControl, Custom UI is forcefully updated whenever this function is envoked to restore UI to whichever settings were chosen.
	3. Added hook for jEnableUserUI, Custom UI is forcefully updated whenever this function is envoked to restore UI to whichever settings were chosen.
	4. FPS Unlocker now should instantly update Warcraft 3 registry values for Refresh Rate and Max FPS.
	5. FPS Unlocker can now be deactivated while game is running, either switch to "Off" mode or disable "Display" button.
	6. @NoCooldown test command now stores all casted spells (only unique values), instead of trying to clear them midfway (as some spells with no cooldown were breaking the iterator).
		This should prevent all known causes of NoColdown mode breaking or not working.
	7. Fixed Hotkeys not working with spellbooks that had Aowk typeid buttons, as they would "lose" their ID while active, hence breaking the check.
	8. Smartcast reworked yet again, loss of control should be totally fixed now whenever multiple keys/buttons are pressed at the same time.
		Note: this is caused by button mashing, which was annoying to track, but now even this shouldn't cause any issues... <_>"
	9. Fixed launcher option for separate stand-alone launcher-apps like w3l.exe/JNLoader.exe and such, WFE should automatically recognise when a launcher file was used instead of the game directly.
	10. Lazy Mode added for Process Name, WFE will now guess between war3.exe and Warcraft III.exe, meaning you can now leave it empty or even set it to a totally wrong name.
	11. NumPad9 is no longer reserved for WFE Save/Update data from config, now it uses a deprecated key as default, to avoid possible conflicts.
	12. WFE launch/inject collision/rare exception error fixed, now WFE shouldn't crash.
	
WFE 3.0.0.0

	1. Internal code update, de-coded a lot of internal frame functions, along with creation of pretty much every single one...
	2. Usage of FDF/TOC files removed, as all of the settings can be handled directly instead.
	3. CooldownUI code fully reworked, it will use even less CPU/RAM.
	4. CooldownUI no longer uses CSimpleTextFrame, instead it uses CTextFrame like HP/MP label.
	5. CooldownUI CTextFrames now are drawn OVER the cooldown indicator (hurray, I finally did it...).
	6. CooldownUI no longer draws floats when below 10, now it will draw floats when cooldown is less than 1. "Example: 9.5 now is 9, and 0.5 will remain as 0.5, etc."
		This should remove sort of unnecessary precision.
	7. *NEW Feature* CooldownUI now allows you to override cooldown indicator with the one in WFEMPQ.mpq "WFEModels\\CooldownUI\\Model.mdx", this option is toggleable, meaning original map indicator won't be lost.
		You can freely edit cooldown indicator to any way you want, WFE will be shipped with original and Alternate versions, which you can interchange by naming the one you like into Model.mdx.
	8. *NEW* Mana Bar now has new field: Mana Text Colour, this will edit the colour of mana labels instead of the static colour that was chosen by me.
	9. HP/MP draw code filly re-written and optimised further, it will use even less CPU/RAM.
	10. Chinese language added, thanks to EdgarL from Discord.
	11. *NEW Feature* WFE can now inject to multiple Warcraft 3 windows, this is mostly for those who use MultiLoader. :)
		This also means, that Update button will send updates to ALL windows that were injected. 
	12. *NEW Feature* WFE now has Version Checker and Auto Updater, it's currently experimental, but once finished you won't need to "hunt" for new versions.
	13. Auto Update feature can be disabled, by default it is Active, if you don't want to check for updates or you want to manually choose when to update, just disable this option.
	
WFE 3.0.0.1

	1. Fixed weird interaction with patch 1.28.5, that would break WFE Launcher if there was War3.exe present along with Warcraft III.exe.
	2. Solved Unhandled Exception error when WFEUpdater is used, since it is trying to update itself while being open.
	
WFE 3.0.0.2

	1. Fixed wrong scaling of Item Cooldown Frames, this was a bug from a long time ago if you were to hide indicator and display it again.
		Note: this surfaced as I am "catching and editing the indicator as it is created, hence this issue surfaced."
	2. WFEUpdater modified and some minor tweaks were done (hopefully for the last time).
		Note: this means you need to re-download 3.0.0.2 from scratch, so it can be updated.
	3. WFEUpdater will now state "No updates available" if there are no pending updates or if you have no internet connection. WFEApp will do so only if you have no internet connection, so there is less spam.
	4. *NEW Feature* you can now ALT + Click on xp bar, to print your current hero's level, his minimum and maximum experience and how much % is left until level up.
		Example: "Zann the Defender (Paladin) >> lvl: 2 | xp: 400/500 (80%)"
	5. Fixed fatal error due to custom TextTag creation, after code optimisation and removal of a "stapled-code" (aka something that shouldn't work was working), the swapped code was going too far within pointers, hence creating fatal error.
	
WFE 3.0.0.3

    1. Fixed and Reworked Auto Injector, for some reason Contains function was not properly distinguishing between processes in a list, so it was indefinitely adding them to the list, while also trying to inject WFEDll.dll.
        Explanation: This is the most likely cause of the high CPU usage by WFEApp.exe, since having a process added each 100ms until all Warcraft 3 are off is really-really problematic as the number gets higher and higher.
        Note to self: never rely on C# libraries and logic in a C++/CLI environment. And never-ever-ever use it again, either use C++ (ImGUI and alike) or straight up C#...
		
WFE 3.0.0.4

	1. Fixed WebClient failing without internet, now all the exceptions will lead WFE to simply ignore further checks and just launch.
	
WFE 3.0.0.5

	1. *NEW Feature* Display section now has a control of the FPS Limiter whenever it should be active while being in "lobby" or just in-game.
		Note: disabling Display section will disable the FPS patch, so it's not a substitute to it, but an expansion.

WFE 3.0.0.6

	1. Fixed Fatal Error if WFEDll.dll was injected while already in-game and PreselectUI had a unit selected/moused over.
	2. Reworked IsGame initial check, now it checks for CGameWar3 instead of Game State, CGameWar3 does not exist in lobby.
	3. Window/Borderless mode no longer looks up for -window argument in WFEApp.exe, now it will instead check window settings.
		Note: this is done via a "hacky" method, but so far on tests with 2 monitors it worked fine.
	4. Fixed weird interaction of TestCommands.ini with Warcraft 3 if WFE is in Warcraft 3 root folder, all commands were loaded out of scope, as for why - no idea, but it's fixed now.
	5. Fixed Fatal Error when starting Multiplayer (Local or Battle.net) game on patches 1.27a-1.28f, somehow 1.24e and 1.26a ended up unscathed, though they should have been affected too.
	
WFE 3.0.0.7

    1. WFEApp will now highlight current Option Section when scrolling down (this was a feature I wanted to introduce long time ago, but was unable to).
        Note: Making this was easier than I thought, but my previous approaches were just wrong, I kind of feel embarrassed about it...
	2. @setacd command fixed, it was not printing text, due to formatting mistake.
	3. @nocd caching removed, code was re-written it should safely remove previously reset spell. This was done due to items permanently "resetting" cooldown due to caching.
		Note: in case some spells will cause @nocd to break, code will be rewritten into a mix of caching and "clearing" for hybrid code.
	4. Alt + Click will no longer "work" on passive buttons, since there is really nothing to print from it.
	5. Alt + Click will no longer print data of Move/Stop/Hold Position/Attack/Patrol buttons.
	6. Alt + Click will no longer print "Not enough mana" on buttons that don't even have mana to begin with.
	7. Manabar code reworked, it will no longer "break" if you injected while in-game. This is achieved by simply fully re-making CStatBar from scratch, rather than expanding it.
	8. Fixed Chat Handler, it was always setting the recipient to whichever was selected in Quick Messages instead of only doing so for Quick Messages.
	9. Settings were re-arranged and some of their section and value names were changed in config, so please re-select all needed options and re-save config file.
	10. *NEW FEATURE* Custom Health Mana Text - this simply controls the hook of Health/Mana labels under portrait.
	11. *NEW FEATURE* Custom Health Mana setting now has new option "Shorten Info", this will simply cut off "/ max value" part of Health/Mana label.
		Note: Health/Mana regen text is not affected by this option. Meaning to disable printing of regen, they have to be disabled separately.
	12. *NEW FEATURE* Now you can set Health label colour, it will fully override the gradient when the colour is not null, or if you don't want it to have a gradient in the first place.
	13. *NEW FEATURE* Custom Bars, this option simply toggles the Health/Mana bar hook, so you can disable it, if you don't care about it.
	14. *NEW FEATURE* Custom Bars Player Colour, this overrides Health Colours option if activated and will draw Player colours on Health Bars instead.
	15. *NEW FEATURE* Custom Bars Extended option, it simply controls if Reforged like drawing of Hero Levels is needed or not.
		Note: this option can ONLY be toggled while outside of the game, there is no workaround around it.
	16. *NEW FEATURE* Upgraded Interface - this option "adopts" Reforged's UI sizing for all frames.
		Note: there are still some issues to be fixed, such as StatBars clipping through UI and Portrait getting clipped by terrain, I am trying to find a way how to fix it.
	17. *NEW FEATURE* Hero Overhead Tip - this option enables/disables the draw for the Overhead tip.
	18. *NEW TEST COMMAND* @setcharges - sets selected/hovered item's charges (this does not work on hovered Item Button, only on the item directly).
	
WFE 3.0.0.8

	1. Fixed silent fatal error when Alt + Clicking on spells that have way too long names, as it was getting out of bounds for message length.
		Note: the fix is a simple cut-off of the Spell Name to prevent crash.
	2. Fixed bug with Damage Draw taking wrong X axis for magical damage.
	3. Fixed sometimes incorrect placement of LevelFrame on units with too wide HPBars.
	4. Fixed bug that caused Button Cooldown Printer to bypass items. Now their cooldown/readiness/mana cost will be printed again.
	5. Fixed the issue that caused InfoBar to disappear along with Console, now once again you can hide Console without losing InfoBar.
	6. Fixed wrong format of Cooldown display, for a fraction of a second "60" would get displayed after "1:00" when Display Minutes was enabled.
	7. UI code "undumbified", all of the UI elements (apart from Group/Building/Cargo) are now first fully "remembered", so they can be restored to the initial data, instead of always using original data.
		Note: this is mostly the solution to the custom UIs breaking while not even using Enhanced UI, as originally I was using fdf data of the clean game, hence the custom UIs were not taken in consideration at all.
	8. Fixed Delay Modifier, it was broken since 3.0.0.0 version, due to code re-work.
	9. *NEW* Added WFEAppStyleDefault.ini, 99% of the colours are controlled from it now, by default the fields are empty, so default values may be taken..
		Note: empty fields will result the default values, aka: SystemColors::Window = 0xFFF0F0F0, Color::DodgerBlue = 0xFF1E90FF, Color::Black = 0xFF000000, SystemColors::Control = 0xFFF0F0F0 and SystemColors::ControlLight = 0xFFE3E3E3.
		Note 2: Suggested usage is to copy it and rename into WFEAppStyle.ini, so your modifications won't be overwritten on each update!
	10. OnWindowProc function updated, removed additional switches, instead fallthrough method is used.

WFE 3.0.0.9
	
	1. Fixed WFEApp Controls re-drawing, all of the buttons/labels/etc. would lose their colour after WFEApp was minimised to tray until Save button was clicked. Now it's restored upon maximisation of the WFEApp.
	2. Fixed fatal error on Game Reload if option Enable UI Modification was disabled, it was caused by custom BackDrop not being created, hence program was avoiding clearing cached data (hence it was re-using instead of updating it with new).
	3. Fixed fatal error on 1.24e, this was caused by the wrong offset of the CLayoutFrame::vtable, so anything that used functions from that vtable (like getting size of CSimpleFrame or CLayoutFrame's) would result in wrong functions being called.
	4. Fixed fatal error on 1.28f, not exactly sure what was causing it, but compared to 3.0.0.7 and 3.0.0.8 it doesn't happen.
	5. Removed CameraSetTargetNoise, CameraSetSourceNoise, CameraSetTargetNoiseEx and CameraSetSourceNoiseEx overrides, so if you injected "late" activated noises would never disable.
	6. Fixed deprecated hotkeys in WFEConfigBase.ini "CTRL, ALT, SHIFT" -> "LCtrl, LAlt, LShift" are used instead.
	7. *NEW FEATURE* Truncate Digits in Custom Health/Mana Text, when active will truncate numbers to thousands (k), millions (m) and billions (b), so 100,000 => 100k, 100,000,000 => 100m, 1,000,000,000 = 1b.
	8. Default Warcraft 3 HP/MP labels is now deprecated, both are seamlessly changed with my own CTextFrames.
	9. New HP/MP Labels will no longer get "hidden" even if they exceed the boundaries set to them.
	11. New HP/MP will also increase in size as the previous version was doing whenever Console is disabled.
	12. *NEW FEATURE* ALT + Click on HP or MP label will print their minimum and maximum value along with percentage: example: HERO >> health: 450/1250 (36%) and similarly for mana.
	13. *NEW FEATURE* ALT + Click on Time of Day Indicator will now print current time to chat.
	14. ALT + Click on items that have no active ability will simply print that a unit has it or no.

WFE 3.0.1.0

	1. Fixed Item Buttons being hidden along with Infobar.
	2. Fixed fatal error caused by updated Draw AoE Indicator code, it was getting out of memory bounds.
	3. Cooldown UI option Display Minutes will now also affect both the CBuff duration text and the cooldown/duration text sent to chat.
	4. Fixed UI not automatically updating after Cinematic Filter in maps that used them from the very start of the game.
	5. WFEApp will now highlight current Option Section when scrolling down with Mouse Wheel. (previously this was only handled if scrollbar with used to scroll down).
	6. WFE HP/MP Custom labels will now use size from fdf by default and apply changes based on it.
	7. Fixed WheelUp and WheelDown not working with any of the binds.
	8. Added MButton as a possible key bind.
	9. Fixed a bug with Cooldown Indicator having wrong size if no override was done and Upgraded UI was enabled (it was getting halved in size for items).
	10. COccupUI (Cargo CStatBar) now will also scale for the widescreen aspect.
	11. Fixed CCargoGrid, now WFE will resize any cargo holder with 5 columns, so they won't "spill out" of the Console UI in Upgraded UI mode.
	
WFE 3.0.1.1

	1. Fixed LocalPlayerId variable in CGameWar3 (it's a int32_t value, that is shifted 2 bytes to the right to get the id, I was directly moving int16_t to int32_t which would never work for any slot other than red).
	2. Fixed Fatal Error of WFE with KLoader multi-window.
	3. Fixed never-ending timer PopulateNavitesListTimerProc, which was responsible for adding all natives to std::map, so it can be re-used all the time, instead it was re-doing that indefinitely...
	4. Added QuestButtonHighlight resizing for Enhanced UI, it used to be "fullsize" regardless of the selected mode
	
WFE 3.0.1.2

	1. Replay Panel is now also modifiable by Upgraded UI.
	2. Fixed some of the UI elements not being able to hide if Upgraded UI was disabled.
	3. *NEW FEATURE* Ally Skill view, this will show abilities of units of your allies along with their cooldowns.
		Note: you are not able to "ping" data of your allies skills, as that is simply a bit too much.
	4. Replay Panel is now a separate option in UI Modification section, meaning you will no longer have to toggle Ability Buttons to make it appear/disappear, etc.
	5. Raised priority of CSimpleConsole (GameUI), CUpperBar (Console Top Left buttons), CResourceBar, CCommandButtons and CSimpleFontString (Inventory text).
		Note: this blocks the Healthbars, etc. from passing through the UI. The only thing that cannot "block" it remains the portrait...
	6. Lowered the priority of COccupUI (cargo statbar) from 4 to 1, now it will be "stopped" near the UI just like HP/MP bars.
	7. *NEW COMMAND* @kill, this command will kill any selected unit/item/destructable.
	8. These buttons are now available for KeyBinds/Hotkeys:
		1) "Scroll"
		2) "Pause"
		3) "Insert"
		4) "Delete"
		5) "Home"
		6) "End"
		7) "PageUp"
		8) "PageDown"
		9) "+"
		10) "-"
		11) "NumPad-"
		12) "NumPad+"
		13) "NumPad/"
		14) "NumPad*"
		15) "NumPad."
		16) "\\"
		17) "/"
		18) "."
		19) ","
		20) "\""
		21) ";"
		22) "["
		23) "]"
	10. Fixed CMinimap offsets for 1.27b, this is the reason why it was failing to resize itself.
	
WFE 3.0.1.3

	1. Increased Replay Panel priority, so it is no longer behind GameUI Console.
		Note: this happened as I forgot to raise its priority to 1 higher than the console's.
	2. Increased Quick Message Hotkey priority, so you can bind Numpad+ and Numpad-.
		Note: if these binds are used, then it will no longer move camera.
	3. Reworked KeyParser API, now it can support SYSKEY + +/NumPad+, previously it was skipping them due to '+' being present, while it originally served as a combination key.
		Note: This does not (and previously did not) affect +/NumPad+ keys being used on their own.
	4. *NEW FEATURE* Buff Bar in Interface Section, this allows you to show/hide buff bar separately, it is no longer attached to InfoBar.
	5. *NEW FEATURE* Upgraded Buff Bar in Interface Section, this allows you to move the buff bar above Console (like it was previously by default in WFE).
	6. *NEW FEATURE* Draw Buff Duration in Interface Section, this allows you to turn on/off Buff Duration drawing.
	7. Fixed old Warcraft 3 bug with Item Cooldown Indicators that failed to hide, and would draw your cooldown on top of the items of your enemy.
		In short, if you use let's say item 'shas' and enemy has item on the slot where you have cooldown indicator active, it will draw on top if, as if it's on cooldown.
		*clap-clap* Blizzard. <_>"
	8. Fixed Magic Resist printer not printing any values, now it's working again.

WFE 3.0.1.4

	1. Fixed UI priority for UpperMenuBar, ResourceBar and Minimap buttons that would have lower priority than the Console at random.
	2. Fixed Cooldown Indicator width in Upgrgraded UI mode not covering the whole button.
	3. Fixed Fatal Error with Multiwindow mode on Warcraft 3, due to malformation of memory by the said feature, added a more robust memory address check to prevent the issue.
	4. Fixed HP/MP labels not being hidden when UI was hidden via ShowInterface or CinematicPanel.
	5. Fixed HP/MP keeping previous values on units that have no HP at all, or have INVULNERABLE state flag, now it will be empty as it should have been.
	6. Fixed CBuffBar and subsequent CBuffs duration from being drawn on units that are not owners of the buff.
		Note: it was breaking due to units not having CBuffBar at all, meaning "Status:" text was hidden along with all frames, etc.
	7. Added Korean translation, thanks to: 까끼꾸 (Discord).
	8. Fixed issue with RMC auto-activating, while any WFE bind for abilities/items/spellbook were held down.
	9. FIxed a bug where LCtrl + G bind would result in the same value as LAlt + 3.
		Note: this was caused by my "obsession" with limiting the occupied bytes, so I was not "multiplying" the modifier value by a high enough number to avoid collisions, so I raised it from 10 to 0x100 (256).
	10. Fixed IgnoreFreeLibrary issue yet again, it was appearing due to the UI Hook that was failing to detach itself, as compared to all other hooks.
	11. Changed default font used from "Fonts\\FRIZQT__.TTF" to MasterFont (aka whichever is being considered as main font by the game build).
		Note: if you wish to override the MasterFont for WFE, use this path: WFEFonts\\Master.ttf.
		Note 2: if you wish to override any font of the game, then simply do the same, but use the paths that the game uses, i.e. Fonts\\FRIZQT__.TTF.
	12. Reworked smartcast feature and removed additional safe check (this was causing some abilities "the auto-castable abilities mostly" to not interact perfectly).
		Note: it was causing the "target circle" to blink, but it would still work overall.
	13. Fixed a bug with Ability/Item keybinds that would use default hotkey if no ability/item was successfully pressed or it cannot be pressed.

WFE 3.0.1.5

	1. Fixed UI Console Upper Left Menu Bar blocking upward camera movement via mouse.
		Note: this was caused by the buttons having higher priority level than the bar itself, which I did to 100% nullify them being behind the bar itself, apparently it is not needed anymore.
	2. Fixed Ally Skill View feature being ON by default, when no config was generated, now the default option is OFF as it was supposed to be.
	3. Fixed Custom Bars Player Colour feature, now it reads ColourId from player correctly, instead of using PlayerId directly.
	4. Added WFEGameColours.ini, this file allows you to change "default" player colours for the Custom Bars Player Colour feature.
	5. Added Percentage option in Custom Health/Mana Text.
	6. Fixed issue with Player Colours affecting Mechanical Critter in Custom Stat Bar, that was drawing owner's colour even for enemies, when it should use Neutral Passive colour instead.
